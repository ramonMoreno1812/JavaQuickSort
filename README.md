Quick Sort Algorithim project. 

This project calls quick sort from this driver class, and from my Sort class.
the quick sort from this class takes in a random int array and sorts it in ascending order. 
The quickSort in my Sort class takes in generic arrays and also sorts them in ascending order. 
Various types of arrays are used in my Generic sorting, including Integer[], String, and Integer[] of random ints.
